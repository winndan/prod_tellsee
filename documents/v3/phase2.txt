🔹 Phase 2 — LLM Analyst (Perception Layer)
🎯 Purpose

Convert messy, real-world competitor information into structured competitive signals.

This is the only probabilistic phase.

🚫 What Phase 2 Does NOT Do

Does not decide strategy

Does not recommend actions

Does not explain implications

Does not invent facts

Does not reuse values across fields

📥 Input

Raw natural language text (≤ 3000 characters)

Example:

“A competitor seems cheaper now, people online are confused, pricing isn’t clear yet.”

⚙️ Processing

LLM is constrained by:

strict field definitions

enum-only values

JSON-only output

Output is validated against schema

Converted to enum-safe domain models

📤 Output

ExtractedContext

{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "name": "Competitor A",
      "signals": {
        "event": "price_change",
        "sentiment": "mixed_positive",
        "clarity": "confusing",
        "price_info": "unknown",
        "market_confusion": "high"
      }
    }
  ],
  "market_signals": [],
  "user_intent": "seeking_response"
}

⚠️ Known Property

Same input may produce slightly different signals

This is expected LLM behavior

Downstream determinism + caching mitigates risk
