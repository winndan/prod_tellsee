🔹 Phase 1 — Strategy Engine (Decision Layer)
🎯 Purpose

Make a single, deterministic decision about whether a business should react or deliberately not react to a competitor move.

This phase answers one question only:

Given what we reliably know right now, what is the safest rational move?

🚫 What Phase 1 Does NOT Do

Does not call LLMs

Does not read raw text

Does not speculate or guess

Does not explain decisions

Does not optimize pricing or forecast outcomes

📥 Input

ExtractedContext (structured, enum-safe)

ExtractedContext(
  competitors: List[Competitor],
  market_signals: List[str],
  user_intent: str
)


Each competitor contains only structured signals, such as:

event

sentiment

clarity

price_info

execution_quality

messaging_strength

market_confusion

⚙️ Processing

Rules are evaluated in priority order

The first matching rule wins

If no rule matches → conservative fallback

Default fallback

strategy_type: wait_and_observe

urgency: low

📤 Output

StrategyDecision

{
  "strategy_type": "positioning_response | pricing_response | wait_and_observe",
  "focus": "string",
  "urgency": "low | medium | high",
  "avoid": []
}

✅ Guarantees

Same input → same decision

Fully auditable

Stateless and replayable

WAIT is a first-class, intentional outcome
