📘 PHASE 2 DOCUMENTATION

LLM Analyst – Language → Signals Layer

1. Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 2 interprets unstructured human language and extracts structured competitive signals.

It exists to answer one question only:

What factual signals can be reliably extracted from the user’s description?

Phase 2 does not decide strategy and does not explain decisions.

2. Role Definition
Role: Analyst (LLM #1)
Capability	Allowed
Read unstructured text	✅
Extract events & signals	✅
Normalize ambiguity	✅
Infer strategy	❌
Recommend actions	❌
Explain implications	❌
Use memory/history	❌

The Analyst understands language but has no business authority.

3. Input Contract (Strict)

Phase 2 accepts raw natural language text only.

Maximum length: 3000 characters

No required structure

No required fields

No context from previous inputs

Example:

“Competitor A launched a new product. People are excited but confused. No pricing yet.”

4. Output Contract (Strict)

Phase 2 outputs structured JSON only, matching this schema:

{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "signals": {
        "event": "new_product_launch | price_change | none",
        "sentiment": "positive | mixed_positive | neutral | negative | unknown",
        "clarity": "clear | confusing | unknown",
        "price_info": "lower | higher | same | unknown"
      }
    }
  ],
  "market_signals": ["string"],
  "user_intent": "seeking_response | monitoring | comparison"
}

5. Enforcement & Guarantees

Phase 2 is enforced by the system, not trust.

Input length validation

JSON-only parsing

Schema validation

Enum constraints

Invalid output is discarded, not corrected.

6. Forbidden Behaviors

Phase 2 must never:

Recommend actions

Suggest strategies

Rank competitors

Compare winners vs losers

Explain implications

If the output “sounds insightful”, it is wrong.

7. Failure Modes & Expected Behavior
Scenario	Output
Missing information	"unknown"
Ambiguous wording	"unknown"
No clear competitor	competitors = []
Invalid JSON	Reject
Schema mismatch	Reject

Rejection is correct behavior.

8. Relationship to Other Phases
Phase 2 → Phase 1 → Phase 3


Phase 2 feeds Phase 1

Phase 3 consumes Phase 1

Phase 2 and Phase 3 never interact directly

9. Phase 2 Mental Model (Pin This)

Phase 2 understands language.
It does not understand business.

10. One-Sentence Phase Definition

Phase 2 extracts structured competitive signals from unstructured user input without making decisions or recommendations.

🔒 COMPLETE PHASE ALIGNMENT (NOW COMPLETE)

All three phases now follow the same documentation pattern:

Section	Phase 1	Phase 2	Phase 3
Purpose	Decide	Extract	Explain
Role	Strategist	Analyst	Advisor
Input	Structured	Unstructured	Structured
Output	Structured	Structured	Structured
AI Usage	❌	✅	✅
Authority	Final	None	None

This symmetry is intentional and protects the system.

🧠 FINAL SYSTEM TRUTH (PIN THIS)

Phase 2 interprets

Phase 1 decides

Phase 3 explains

Nothing overlaps.
