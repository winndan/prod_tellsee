📘 PHASE 3 DOCUMENTATION

Advisor LLM – Strategy Explanation Layer

1. Purpose of Phase 3

Phase 3 explains decisions that have already been made.

It exists to:

Translate structured strategy decisions into human language

Increase clarity, confidence, and actionability

Provide reasoning without adding intelligence

Phase 3 never influences outcomes.

2. Role Definition
LLM Role: Advisor (LLM #2)
Capability	Allowed
Explain a strategy	✅
Rephrase decisions clearly	✅
Provide rationale	✅
Change strategy	❌
Introduce new facts	❌
Reinterpret signals	❌
Read raw user text	❌

Phase 3 is downstream-only and explanation-only.

3. Input Contract (Strict)

Phase 3 receives only compressed, system-approved input.

{
  "strategy_type": "positioning_response | pricing_response | wait_and_observe",
  "focus": "string",
  "urgency": "low | medium | high",
  "signals": ["string"]
}

Key Rules

No competitor names unless explicitly included

No raw text

No prices unless already decided

Signals are labels, not narratives

4. Output Contract

Phase 3 must output valid JSON only:

{
  "advice": "string",
  "reason": "string",
  "confidence": "low | medium | high"
}

Interpretation

advice → What to do

reason → Why this works (based only on input)

confidence → How strongly the system believes this applies

5. Enforcement & Safety

Phase 3 is protected by:

Schema validation (input & output)

Prompt-level constraints

No access to raw user input

No access to strategy rules

If Phase 3 output is removed, the system decision remains unchanged.

6. Failure Modes (Expected & Correct)
Scenario	Behavior
Invalid JSON	Reject output
Extra fields	Reject output
Hallucinated facts	Reject output
Strategy mismatch	Reject output

Rejection is a feature, not a bug.

7. Phase 3 Exit Criteria (LOCK)

Phase 3 is considered DONE and FROZEN when:

 Output always validates against schema

 No strategy drift is possible

 No new facts appear

 Removing Phase 3 does not change outcomes

 Tone is consistent and neutral

Once locked, Phase 3 should never be expanded with logic.

8. Phase 3 Mental Model (Pin This)

Phase 3 speaks.
It does not think.
