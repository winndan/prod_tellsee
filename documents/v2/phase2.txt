🔹 Phase 2 — LLM Analyst (Perception Layer)
🎯 Purpose

Convert unstructured competitor information into structured competitive signals.

This is the only probabilistic phase.

🚫 What Phase 2 does NOT do

Does not decide strategy

Does not explain outcomes

Does not invent facts

Does not reuse values across fields

📥 Input

Raw competitor text (≤ 3000 characters)

Example:

“Competitor A launched a new product. Users are interested but confused…”

⚙️ Processing

LLM is instructed with strict field definitions

Output is constrained via:

Explicit allowed values

JSON-only format

Output is validated against ExtractedContextSchema

Converted to enum-safe domain models

📤 Output

ExtractedContext

Example (simplified):

{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "name": "Competitor A",
      "signals": {
        "event": "new_product_launch",
        "sentiment": "mixed_positive",
        "clarity": "confusing",
        "execution_quality": "weak",
        "market_confusion": "high"
      }
    }
  ],
  "market_signals": [],
  "user_intent": "comparison"
}

⚠️ Known Property

The same input may produce slightly different signals across runs

This is expected LLM behavior
