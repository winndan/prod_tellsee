📘 Competitive Intelligence Engine
Phase 1–Phase 4 Documentation (Final)
🧠 System Goal (Context)

The system provides competitive analysis with strategic edge by:

Interpreting messy competitor information

Converting it into structured competitive signals

Making deterministic strategy decisions

Explaining decisions clearly and defensibly

Key principle:

Only perception is probabilistic. Decisions are deterministic.

🔹 Phase 1 — Strategy Engine (Decision Layer)
🎯 Purpose

Make a single, deterministic strategy decision based on structured competitive signals.

🚫 What Phase 1 does NOT do

Does not call LLMs

Does not interpret raw text

Does not guess or speculate

Does not explain decisions

📥 Input

ExtractedContext (domain dataclass)

ExtractedContext(
  competitors: List[Competitor],
  market_signals: List[str],
  user_intent: str
)


Each competitor includes enum-safe signals:

event

sentiment

clarity

price_info

execution_quality

messaging_strength

market_confusion

⚙️ Processing

Rules are evaluated in order

First matching rule wins

If no rule matches → fallback strategy

WAIT → monitoring → low urgency

📤 Output

StrategyDecision

{
  "strategy_type": "positioning_response | pricing_response | wait_and_observe",
  "focus": "...",
  "urgency": "low | medium | high",
  "avoid": [...]
}

✅ Guarantees

Same input → same decision

Fully auditable

No randomness
